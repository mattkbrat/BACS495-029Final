## Option 1: Core

**Overview**

For this option, you will build a website that represents the core of what you need to learn in this course. The concept is simple but there are options to make it more difficult if you choose. The Core Project is to build a knowledge sharing website for college students taking courses at a university. Think Stackoverflow or Quora for college students. The concept is that students should be able to log in and post / answer questions about various topics such as “what are the best non-paid parking spots near campus” to “how long should I wait for a response before bugging a professor again”. The questions should be able to be voted on as well as answers voted up and accepted as accurate by the original poster.
